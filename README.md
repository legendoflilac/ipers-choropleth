# IPERS Benefit Payments and Payees by County Project

### February 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Using the same template as the 100 Days of Code log to write about my progress on my personal choropleth map. Today I worked on implementing a legend, which was a bit trickier than the one I did for the example project because the numbers needed formatted some in order to be human-readable. However, the implementation was largely the same--make rects and a scale/axis for the legend, get each section to be a different fill color, and place the tick values as needed. 

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking I'll need to change the projection of the map to a Mercator view to make it look better with my horizontal legend. Not looking forward to having to play with the scale and such again to make that work...
